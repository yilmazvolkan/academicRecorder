# Academic Recorder


# Introduction


In this project, I implement UI that shows the academic sota results in computer science. In the system, I have authors, papers and topics. Each paper consists of multiple authors and topics. Furthermore, I have a sota result for each
topic. It states the best result among the paper with respect to this particular topic. I implemented this project on PHP and the most important part is creating and designing the database. In order to accomplish this task, I need to create complex tables and connections among them.
